# Please Hold
_Track the time you waste with Centrelink. Everything stays on your device._

Please Hold is a time tracking app designed for Australians who receive welfare payments. Use PH whenever you have to do something to keep your payment going: go into a Centrelink office, call someone, fill in a form. PH asks you when things happened and records each interaction. You can then view your interaction history and see statistics on how much time you've wasted.

PH is designed to be used locally: all of the important stuff is stored in your browser's `localStorage`, so there's no need to worry about personal information drifting off into the cloud. It also means that PH largely works offline. One downside, however, is that it's not suitable for people who only have access to shared or public computers (who make up a substantial fraction of Centrelink recipients).
